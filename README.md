I got help on this lab from C2C Ryan Good, C2C Michael Bentley, and C2C Colin Busho. Ryan essentially advised me that I could hard code the output of the leds and input to the switches 4 bits at a time instead of making one method. C2C Bentley gave me advice on how to take three characters as opposed to just the one. Colin helped me with the VHDL file for the switches. I had no idea how to do any of it without him.
